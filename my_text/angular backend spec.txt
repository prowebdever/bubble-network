1. Please study these 2 Admin panels. You will notice a lot of Dashboard cards in use in Option B. I need those mini Dashboards to be available in Option A.

Freelancer should introduce sub menus for the main menus ON OPTION A. Please check FIGMA layout 


- Create Submenus for the menus on left and create Micro Dashboards for the sections. 


For instance Riders.


Riders

  --Single Rides 

  -- Pool Rides 

  --Keke


When user selects the sub menu  - a set of Dashboards showing counters display with logs.


Single -  Mini Dashboard + Logs

Keke - Mini Dashboard + Logs

Pool - Mini Dashboard + Logs


Do same for Drivers, Riders, etc on the system. Mini Dashboards with counters.

Hello,

I have 2 back end codes for my ride hailing app.

I want to merge functionalities at the back end into a new back end. I have a new UI for that purpose and will be willing to show you.

New proposed Admin:

I want functionalities in Option B moved to Option A.

That would be first stage of Project.

There are mobile apps which work on the back ends but I want the new functionalities to work in mobile apps linked to Option A.
